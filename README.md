## Help:

`pip install smart_text_randomizer`

"Text randomization" or "variable text". It is used to create different variations of the same message.

You are using special syntax. Example: `'{Salute|Hello|Good morning} {comrade|buddy|dear friend}!'`

This syntax allows you to create variable messages by using curly braces and vertical bars to indicate alternatives.

Basic elements of syntax:

1. Curly braces {}: Used to group text options. Anything inside the curly braces will be randomly selected when generating the text.
2. Vertical bar |: Used to separate different text options within curly braces. Each option will be treated as a separate choice.

Example of use:

- Syntax: `'{Salute|Hello|Good morning} {comrade|buddy|dear friend}!'`
- Possible results:
    - Salute comrade!
    - Salute buddy!
    - Salute dear friend!
    - Hello comrade!
    - Hello buddy!
    - Hello dear friend!
    - Good morning comrade!
    - Good morning buddy!
    - Good morning dear friend!
- How to use:
  1. Create your text: Identify which parts of your message can vary and place them in curly braces.
  2. Add options: Separate alternatives with a vertical bar.
  3. Text Generation: Use RandomStringMaster() to generate a random message.

- Notes:
    - Make sure all options inside the curly braces make sense and fit the context.
    - You can use multiple randomization groups in a single message to create more complex variations.


Example of text randomization:

```python
from smart_text_randomizer import TextRandomizer

text_randomizer = TextRandomizer()

text = '{Salute|Hello|Good morning} {comrade|buddy|dear friend}!'
randomized_text = TextRandomizer.randomize(text)
print(randomized_text) # Good morning buddy!
```
